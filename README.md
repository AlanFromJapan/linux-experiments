# Linux experiments
## Helper scripts
Some scripts I made to NOT have to remember the command lines. Will they work for you? Go ahead and try.
Talks about S3 bucket mounting, Veracrypt folders, etc.

## Default installer

Linux is great. BUT you have to sometimes reinstall everything in my experience when you tinker too much (or the distro desides so).
So instead of redoing all by hand, a few scripts that will install "most" of the defaults that I like to have installed on my PC.
